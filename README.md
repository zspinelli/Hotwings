tor link: http://g6jy5jkx466lrqojcngbnksugrcfxsl562bzuikrka5rv7srgguqbjid.onion/fa/

to use this you'll have to open the tor browser and leave it open while you run the scraper. the scraper doesn't interact with it, i haven't put any work into
figuring out how to make the script find and start the tor service on it's own.
